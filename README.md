# Blueberry Network Rewiring
Breed new blueberry cultivars that are resistant to the blueberry stem gall wasp. Examine standing genetic variation in the population of blueberry cultivars to identify resistant blueberry cultivars and the genomic loci responsible.

[Previously](https://github.com/EdgerLab/Blueberry_RNA_Seq_Expression_Analysis), differentially expressed genes were quantified from RNA-Seq data gathered from Liberty and Draper cultivars. Work now continues on comparing metabolic pathway flux and structure following gene expression perturbation following gall wasp infection.

The code is broken up into several different scripts inside the `src/` directory. The files are as follows:

## Arabidopsis Blueberry Orthology:
- `filter_orthologs.py`: Master code file for executing and filtering gene orthology data. Creates an ortholog table by merging a set of syntelogs (SynMap) and a set of homologs (BLAST).
	- Inputs: raw syntelog data from SynMap, see [SynMap Methods](#identifying-syntelogs), raw homolog data from BLAST, see [BLAST Methods](#identifying-homologs).

The code found in `src/WGCNA` is an adapted version of the tutorials, there are no clinical traits that I am relating modules to.

## Log\_2FC\_Melanie TODO flesh out more at a later date after conferring with Melanie:

# Methods Descriptions:
## Ortholog Identification
Genome-wide analyses were performed to identify *Arabidopsis thaliana* â€“ *Vaccinium corymbosum* orthologs using a combination of synteny- and BLAST- based approaches using SynMap and reciprocal BLASTp analyses (protein databases).
Ortholog pairs with E-values greater than or equal to 0.05 were excluded from both datasets.
In the event that SynMap or BLASTp returned multiple Arabidopsis genes for a single blueberry gene, the Arabidopsis ortholog with the best (lowest) E-value score was kept.
In the event that a blueberry gene had an ortholog identified through BLASTp and SynMap, we gave priority to the SynMap synteny results, preferentially keeping that ortholog pair.

### SynMap for Syntelogs:
[SynMap](https://genomevolution.org/CoGe/SynMap.pl) was run on the CoGe website. I ran SynMap with mostly [default options](https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/SynMap), I did change one option: under *Merge Syntenic Blocks* I set it to `Quota Align Merge`. Here is the [link](https://genomevolution.org/r/1ejoj) to regenerate the analysis on CoGe.

### BLASTp for Homologs:
We are doing this step to identify homologs that may have been missed using a synteny-based approach.
Genes that could have been missed by the synteny search include single-gene transpositions (and others).
We are going to use a BLAST database of protein predictions.
First we generate a BLAST database and prepare it for protein indices.
Then we can run the BLAST algorithm on the two sequence files, this may take awhile.
For notes on the options for `blastall`, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/BLAST/blastallopts.txt).

TODO the blastp database was generated via...
